## Overview

TrustGuard is a research prototype exploring AI-powered approaches to content verification and misinformation detection. The application demonstrates how machine learning principles could be applied to analyze digital content for credibility, bias, and source reliability.

**Live Demo**: [https://trust-guard-vh44.vercel.app/](https://trust-guard-vh44.vercel.app/)

## Key Features

- **Real-time Content Analysis**: Instant credibility scoring for text and URL inputs
- **Multi-factor Assessment**: Evaluates source credibility, factual accuracy, bias detection, and content recency
- **Educational Resources**: Built-in learning modules about misinformation identification
- **Transparent Methodology**: Clear breakdown of analysis factors and confidence levels
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized interface for accessibility across devices
- **Source Verification**: Integration with credibility rankings for news sources

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, React Router DOM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom professional design system
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Icons**: Lucide React, React Icons
- **Animations**: Custom CSS transitions and React Type Animation

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **This is a research prototype** - The application currently uses simulated AI responses for demonstration purposes. All analysis results are generated algorithmically to showcase potential functionality and user experience design.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Fahad035/trustguard.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd trustguard

# Install dependencies
npm install
